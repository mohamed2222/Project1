
Vector v = {0, NULL}// TWO TYPES: INTEGER, POINTER

unsigned int length;
double  *element;


unsigned int rows;
unsigned int cols;
double  **element;//pointer to pointer to beginning of double (OTHER APPROACH IS CREATING A LONG LIST WITH ROW NUMBERS FIRST FOLLOWED BY COLUMNS)

free (ptr) //ptr to beginning of memory block


gcc -c file.c -o file.o (compile each file individually WITH MAIN PROGRAM LAST)
gcc file1.o file2.o file3.o -o program (linked)



int main(int arg c, char *argv[])//arg c - number of arguments (program name counts as an argument)
//arg v - contains array of strings

Range of projects: C++ project completed as part of the Advanced programming module in Year 1 of my Electrical and Electronic Engineering degree. The function of the project is detecting events on a window e.g. cursor movement/button click, and copying the same events onto a separate window. The final product was that a user could draw a shape on one window and the other window automatically draws that shape simultaneously.
